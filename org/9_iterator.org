* Song Collection Manager
** Use Case

You’re tasked with managing a small song collection for a local music
club. Use a vector to store song titles, display them using an
iterator, and search for a specific song. This exercise introduces
vector operations and iterator usage, preparing you for more complex
tasks like the Playlist Manager exercise in CSC 240. No starter code
or anything - breathe freely!.

** Instructions
1. Add the necessary header files.
2. Create a string vector called =songs= and populate it with at least 4
   unique song titles (e.g., "Rock Anthem", "Jazz Groove", "Pop Hit",
   "Blues Tune").
3. Use a ~for~ loop with an iterator to print each song title with a
   1-based index.
4. Add a search function using an iterator to check if "Jazz Groove"
   is in the list. If found, print "Jazz Groove is in the
   collection!"; otherwise, print "Jazz Groove not found!".
5. This should take about 45 minutes, including reading the
   instructions, reviewing iterator usage from "The STL Vector
   Class.pdf" in GitHub, coding, and testing. 
6. Be prepared to discuss your solution in the next class.

** Sample Output
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Song Collection:
1: Rock Anthem
2: Jazz Groove
3: Pop Hit
4: Blues Tune

Search Result:
Jazz Groove is in the collection!
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Solution Code (with Detailed Pseudocode Comments)
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :main no :includes :results output :exports both
  // header files  
  #include <iostream>
  #include <vector>
  #include <string>

  int main() {
    // create and populate vector with at least 4 song titles
    std::vector<std::string> songs;
    songs.push_back("Rock Anthem");      // Add first song to the vector
    songs.push_back("Jazz Groove");      // Add second song to the vector
    songs.push_back("Pop Hit");          // Add third song to the vector
    songs.push_back("Blues Tune");       // Add fourth song to the vector

    // use iterator to display song list with 1-based indices
    std::cout << "Song Collection:\n";   // Print header for the song list
    int index = 1;                       // Initialize counter for 1-based indexing
    for (std::vector<std::string>::iterator it = songs.begin(); it != songs.end(); ++it) {
      // Pseudocode: FOR each element in vector using iterator
      //    Print the current index followed by ": " and the song name
      //    Increment index for next position
      std::cout << index << ": " << *it << std::endl;  // Dereference iterator to access each song
      ++index;
    }

    // use iterator to search for "Jazz Groove" and print result
    std::vector<std::string>::iterator searchIt = songs.begin();  // Set iterator to start of vector
    bool found = false;                                          // Initialize flag to track if song is found
    while (searchIt != songs.end()) {
      // Pseudocode: WHILE iterator has not reached end of vector
      //    IF current song equals "Jazz Groove"
      //       Set found flag to true
      //       Exit loop
      //    Move iterator to next element
      if (*searchIt == "Jazz Groove") {
        found = true;    // Mark that the song was found
        break;           // Exit the loop since we found the song
      }
      ++searchIt;          // Move to the next song in the vector
    }
    std::cout << "\nSearch Result:\n";  // Print header for search result
    if (found) {
      // Pseudocode: IF found flag is true
      //    Print "Jazz Groove is in the collection!"
      std::cout << "Jazz Groove is in the collection!\n";
    } else {
      // Pseudocode: ELSE
      //    Print "Jazz Groove not found!"
      std::cout << "Jazz Groove not found!\n";
    }

    return 0;

* Potential Learnings from Song Collection Manager

The potential learnings are a summary of things to learn about ~vector~
and ~iterator~ objects in C++:

- Vector Operations
  + Using =std::vector= for dynamic storage of strings
  + Adding elements with =push_back()=
  + Automatic memory allocation by vectors
- Iterator Usage
  + Employing =std::vector<std::string>::iterator= for traversal
  + Using =begin()= and =end()= for range
  + Dereferencing with =*it= and incrementing with =++it=
  + Writing container-agnostic code
- Looping with Iterators
  + Using a =for= loop with iterators
  + Maintaining a manual 1-based index
  + Understanding iterator control flow vs. raw indexing
- Search Logic
  + Implementing linear search with a =while= loop and iterator
  + Using a =bool= flag to track search results
  + Breaking early when target ("Jazz Groove") is found
- STL Best Practices
  + Including necessary headers (=<iostream>=, =<vector>=, =<string>=)
  + Using =std::= namespace explicitly for clarity
- Debugging and Clarity
  + Writing pseudocode as comments to plan logic
  + Catching errors early through planning
  + Aligning with course’s emphasis on pre-coding planning
